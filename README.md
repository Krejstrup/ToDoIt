# Assignment 3 ToDoIt
## The ToDoIt - the comand line version.

This is the third assignment we got for the .Net Core C# course.
Two persons used GitHub to collaborate on the project. We do not make any claims for best solution or best practice. Allthough we have been trying to keep the solution as readable and code friendly as we could.
The Objectivces was to learn about Arrays, OOP, Encapsulation, Relations between objects (aggregation and Composition), Testing using xUnit, Agile Workflow and Collaboration.
The code do not use much in-line comments, but uses the Visual Studio documentation of methods.
Also take a look at the Class Diagram based on UML for an overview of the classes.

Please take a look at the work, and I hope you can enjoy it!

**Short about the program:**<br>
The program has no really usage besides of us having a really good assignment and excercise.
All developement of this program has been test driven and the tests is based on different scenarious that has made us make the code better. Test driven developement has taken us to, in our beleves, a faster developement pace of this code. Everything here was done by two persons in two workdays.
If you would like, for some reason, to test it out the only thing right now that works is the tests. There are no interface to the Classes.
